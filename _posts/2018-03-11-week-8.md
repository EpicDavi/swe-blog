title: Week 8 - But Spring Break Tho
---

## Past Week

This past week I made it to Spring Break. Thank god.

In IDB, we have now set up a fully-functional React frontend workflow. Hopefully, we can get
progress quickly in that regard. With regards to the backend, I have set up the scraper to load
data for two of the models to our database (still need to load the last model). I have also
set up the API to pull data from our database for those models.

## Blockers

There are no blockers for me this week.

## Next Week

This week I really just want to relax. However, that probably won't happen to the degree
that I want. I have projects and tests in all my classes the week we return from break.
Many classes taut that they "don't assign work over Spring Break", which is _technically_ 
true. In actuality, all the work is piled on for when we return with no hope of completing
it all if you start any later than halfway through the break.

With that rant out of the way, I have a lot to work on in relation to the IDB project for
this week.

## Experience

My experience in the class has not changed since my last blog post.

## pick-of-the-week

My pick-of-the-week is have a good Spring Break!
