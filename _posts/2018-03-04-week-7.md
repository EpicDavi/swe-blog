title: Week 7 - Making It Through
---

## Past Week

This was definitely one of the more rough weeks of my semester so far. I had a Graphics project,
Algorithms test, and SWE test all due on Thursday alone. Didn't do as well as I wanted on the
Algorithms test, but I am glad this week is over.

As for our project, we finished most of the framework for scraping and set up the database. We 
still need to hook up our scraper to send data to our database.

As a step towards frontend work, as of today we have a successfully building React workflow. This
was a bigger headache than I expected, as it was very difficult to use tutorials that were more
than a year old. This is due to the constant flux in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Blockers

As with last week, a lot of the blockers for getting certain parts of the project done are simply
resolving "dependencies" for those tasks. 

## Next Week

This upcoming week, I definitely want to get our group completely started on the React frontend.
As stated earlier, we have set up the basic React workflow; we just need to actually start coding.

As for myself, I will probably start working on the API or finishing up the scraper (specifically
loading scraper data into the database).

## Experience

Not much has changed of my opinion of this class. I am hoping the other test will be as easy as
this first one.

## pick-of-the-week

My pick**s**-of-the-week are [`WebGL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
and [`pocket.gl`](http://pocket.gl/).

WebGL is like a browser version of [`OpenGL`](https://www.opengl.org/),
which is an interface and library for rending graphics, usually on a GPU. We started to learn
`OpenGL` for my graphics class that I have found immensely interesting. It was so cool that
I could port mostly all my `OpenGL` code to work and share in a browser via `WebGL`.

`pocket.gl` is a project built with `WebGL` and [`three.js`](https://threejs.org/) (a library
that abstracts a bit away from `WebGL`). `pocket.gl` allows you to easily create embedded
demos for your `WebGL` projects by simply specifying a couple of parameters and providing
your shaders.

Below this is an example sample shader I made that generates waves. You can even go into the
`Vertex Shader` or `Fragment Shader` tabs and modify the shaders basically in real time.

<script type="text/javascript">
    window.addEventListener("load", function () {
        new PocketGL("pocketOcean", "http://daviskr.com/RandomProjects/PocketOcean/params.js", "http://daviskr.com/RandomProjects/PocketOcean/");
    });
</script>
