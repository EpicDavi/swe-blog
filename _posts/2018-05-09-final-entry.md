It is finally the end. Here are my thoughts about the class:

### Like Least

I really didn't like how this class was structured. Much of the first part of the class is essentially just 
a Python tutorial. This made the required lectures very tedious to go to if you already knew the material. 
I think being able to test out of sections would be very beneficial.

### Like Most

I very much enjoyed working with my team and becoming friends with them. I did not know many people taking this 
class, so I was very happy to quickly become friends with the random team I joined. I wish them the best in the future.

### Most Significant Learning

Even though I had a little bit of prior experience with it, React was probably the biggest skill I improved 
on this semester. I previously knew the syntax and basic structure of React by messing around with it a bit, 
but having worked with it during this non-trivial project, I am now much more well versed with the inner workings 
and quirks of React. This also helped my grasp of asynchronous programming, heavily utilizing JavaScript 
Promises.

### Coding Time

Our group met up in person to do all our programming, so our numbers are probably a bit inflated 
compared to other groups because we did not code by ourselves. Having said that, I believe our group
met for around ~10 hours a week, split up across multiple days. I think this could be cut down signficantly 
by efficiently distributing the work.

### Reading Time

I spend on average ~0 hours per week reading for this class. At the beginning of the semester, 
many of the quizzes were focused on the reading. However, many of the quizzes focused on content 
later in the year (which I personally believe is better).

If you have extra time, I would suggest reading but it is not required to get an A in the class.

### Lines of Code

I don't really have an accurate number for the lines of code that I wrote, since many of the files I 
committed were JSON files and such. Doing a quick estimate, I probably wrote over 10,000 LOC.

### Required Tools

As stated earlier, I benefitted immensely from using React in this project. It is a very good framework to 
learn, if not just to see how these kinds of frameworks are structured.

### Unrequired Tools

One tool I wish I learned earlier is debgugging [source maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Use_a_source_map). 
These map source code to the "compiled" JavaScript code. This is very useful for debugging the React JSX 
source code!

### Couse changes

I would definitely make the lectures optional or at least be able to test out of them. As stated earlier, 
for people who already know the material, it is annoying to have to sit through lecture everyday.

I would possibly change the course material to focus on teaching different tools. The introduction to Docker 
and related tools was very interesting at the beginning of the semester.
